# SLEIC 3T Fees and Billing Policies

## Fees and billing

Magnet time is valuable and expensive. We expect investigators who wish to conduct imaging studies to either have in hand or be serious about acquiring external funding to support their imaging-related research.

The per-hour charge for the 3T magnet is $507.15, rounded to the nearest quarter hour.  The charge-out rate is reassessed and re-approved annually.  Grants should include an inflation factor of 3% for each fiscal year (starting July 1, 2013). 

## Session length for billing purposes

We are moving toward a "time clock" model. We have purchased a time clock for this purpose and will begin using it on MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2013.

*START*: When an investigator enters the control room to do work in preparation for a session or gives the MR Tech screening paperwork, whichever is earlier.

*END*: When the investigator and/or participant leaves the control room, whichever is later.

The difference between these times, rounded up to the nearest 15 min will be the "billed" time.

## Session length for scheduling purposes

Protocols vary in complexity and length and with investigator experience. When scheduling a new protocol, a good guess about session length is the duration of the entire set of scans plus 15 minutes. For well-established protocols, session length can be determined based on the typical session length used in billing, as described above. SLEIC staff will advise research teams about how long a session must be scheduled. It serves no one's interest to schedule sessions shorter than are actually taking place.

## Gap between scheduled sessions

It is essential for safe and sanitary operations that 15 min be allowed between scanning sessions. To enforce this, all appointments must be scheduled 15 min after the end of the previously scheduled session. The 15 min gap applies to back-to-back appointments made by the same research team.

If investigators scheduling appointments do not leave the 15 min gap, the scanner operator will move an appointment start time to create the gap.

For the time being, the 15 min gap will be billed as in-kind time associated with the session it follows. So, if rog1_symm runs from 1:00 to 1:45, the next appointment should not start before2:00. The rog1_symm protocol will be billed for 45 min of scanner time and 15 min of in-kind development time.

The mock scanner is freely available for use at no cost.   

## Billing Frequency

Investigators will receive a bill for scan time on a monthly basis.

## Cancellations

You should notify SLEIC as soon as possible when you are unable to use a scheduled time slot, at minimum 24 hours before. We are NOT charging for late cancellations yet, but we are logging late cancellations and may charge for them in the future.

## No refunds for in-kind studies

We do not refund hours for in-kind studies. If you find that you need additional hours beyond the original grant, we are happy to discuss that.
